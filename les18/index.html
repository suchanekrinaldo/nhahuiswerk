                        A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. Zip. That easy. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. Just beat the devil out of it. Here's another little happy bush Just make a decision and let it go. You can create anything that makes you happy.
                    </p>

                        And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. Use your imagination, let it go. Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. Trees cover up a multitude of sins. And just raise cain.

                        I'm gonna add just a tiny little amount of Prussian Blue. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. Learn when to stop. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. Let's get wild today. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend.
